# COIT13229-Assessment-3
Assessment 3 for COIT13229 
Going to be intense as it is a huge step up from assessments 1 and 2 

Assumptions: 
* No mention of KeyStore or saving the keys, so could say an assumption is that the system is meant to have 100% uptime
* Passwords stored as plaintext (no hashing)
* One order per customer - customers can edit their order week to week
* Admin & Customer are different accounts - admin wont be placing orders from the admin account
* Each customer only has 1 address
* must be logged in to place an order
